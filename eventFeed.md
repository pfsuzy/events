Feb 13, MON - **HENRY SCHIPPER FILMS** at Unurban 3301 Pico, FREE, 4pm  -Schipper's engaging documentaris - on Eartha Kitt (42 minutes, 2016) at 6pm Actress, singer, activist, legend, Eartha Kitt's life and career have been wrapped in mystique since she burst on the scene in the 1950s  singing instant classics like "Santa Baby" and "C'est Si Bon".  A true original, Kitt was a pioneering African American presence on Broadway and in Hollywood, and her turn as Catwoman in the 1960s Batman series brought her mainstream acclaim. Uncompromising in her personal life as well as professionally, she publicly confronted Lady Bird Johnson in the White House about the Vietnam War, and she scarcely worked again in the US for ten years. But a new generation embraced Miss Kitt in the 1990s with films like _Boomerang_, and appearances on _Living Single_ and _New York Undercover._ This show explores the woman and the myth. Those interviewed include Reggie Hudlin, Norma Miller, Tessa Thompson, Dick Gregory, Robin Givens and Freda Payne.  And **Rudy Ray Moore, AKA, "Dolemite"** (42 minutes, 2016) at 645pmUnderground legend Rudy Ray Moore nailed his legacy in the mid 1970s with a series of films built around the funkiest superhero of the Blaxploitation era, Dolemite.  Before that, Moore had built a rep as a stand up comedian and recording artist with hard core comedy routines that would have made Redd Foxx blush.  But it was Dolemite, the trash-talking rhymester from the hood, who put him on the map and planted some of the earliest seeds of rap.  Interviews include Big Daddy Kane, Guy and Joe Torry, Too Short, Richard Sandfield, and Luenell. Free Jazz with Films at 4pm [Jazz Funk Fest](http://www.laughtears.com/jazzfunkfest.html)

Hilarious and melancholy at the same time, it marks Reuben as an important American film talent."---David Ehrenstein.
